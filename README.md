# UIFramework

UIFramework is a lightweight, custom JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. With JSX-like syntax, it provides developers with a simple way to create and render UI components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser and a recent version of Node.js installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ui-framework
```
3. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Usage

1. Create a new JSX component:
```jsx
import UIFramework from './ui-framework.js';

const App = () => (
    <>
        <h1>Hello, UIFramework!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple test.</p>
    </>
);

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    UIFramework.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
});
```
2. In your HTML, you can now use the created component:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Your App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/path-to-your-jsx-file.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Features

JSX-like syntax: Easily describe your UI using a syntax you're already familiar with.
Custom rendering: Render your components efficiently and intuitively.
Lightweight: No heavy dependencies or unnecessary overhead.
